# How to contribute to this project

We love to have your help in the project. At the current stage of the project, these are our priorities:

- Tell us how you can help.
    - You are good at react? open an issue and tell us you'll help us in the creation of the web service. 
    - You know another object detection model (other than YOLOv5 or YOLO at all), introduce it to us. 
    - You are good at gathering data? we'd love to have you here specially if your first name is Vahid.
- Report logical problems in the code.
- Help us in data gathering or generation.
- Help us in data labeling.

Of course the list above will be updated when project progressed.

## How to send a PR?

- First, you have to create a fork of your own. 
- Then you have to clone it to your local computer (we assume your github id is _john_):
    ```git clone https://github.com/john/persian_ocr_project``` 
- After that please create a new branch and do not touch `main`, `development` or any other branch which we're working on. For creating a branch you just need to do this:
    ```git checkout -b my-awesome-branch```
- Make all your desired changes, push it to your forked repository and then submit a PR.

### Important notes about PR's

- PR's are always welcome. But some may not meet the standards of the project. If your PR hasn't been accepted by us without any explanation, you're free to ask for a reason. 
- If one of your PR's rejected, do not panic and do not worry. It's not a date, it's an open source project. So you have the chance to be accepted for another contribution. 
- We currently (as of June 17th 2022) have developed no real application around these models or datasets. So we won't accept PR's claiming to develop a tool around our work. Also we haven't released any model or dataset to the date. Please be patient about tools we're providing. After that, you have our warmest welcomes for PR's and stuff.
