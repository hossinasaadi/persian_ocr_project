# Persian OCR Project

This repository is my biggest [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) project. I had it in my mind since the last year, when I was working on an _automatic license plate number recognition_ project. So what I was thinking of was this _a big FLOSS project_ and then, the idea of an OCR project came to my mind as well. 

Now I started working on the whole idea and this repository will be updated for every phase of the project.
