# How to contribute to this project

We love to have your help in the project. At the current stage of the project, these are our priorities:

- Tell us how you can help.
    - You are good at react? open an issue and tell us you'll help us in the creation of the web service. 
    - You know another object detection model (other than YOLOv5 or YOLO at all), introduce it to us. 
    - You are good at gathering data? we'd love to have you here specially if your first name is Vahid.
- Report logical problems in the code.
- Help us in data gathering or generation.
- Help us in data labeling.

Of course the list above will be updated when project progressed.

## How to send a PR?

- First, you have to create a fork of your own. 
- Then you have to clone it to your local computer (we assume your github id is _john_):
    ```git clone https://github.com/john/persian_ocr_project``` 
- After that please create a new branch and do not touch `main`, `development` or any other branch which we're working on. For creating a branch you just need to do this:
    ```git checkout -b my-awesome-branch```
- Make all your desired changes, push it to your forked repository and then submit a PR.
